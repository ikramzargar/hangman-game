Hangman Game (Flutter)
This is a fun implementation of the classic Hangman game built using Flutter.

Overview
Hangman is a word guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game continues until the word is guessed correctly or the hangman is fully drawn.

Features
Single Player Mode: Play against the computer and guess the hidden word.
Interactive UI: Engaging user interface designed with Flutter for an enjoyable gaming experience.
Visual Feedback: See the hangman being drawn with each incorrect guess.
